I'm not very knowledgeable about wine, so I tend to shy away from places that have an attitude.  We  also had one of the 1000 outstanding Groupons about to expire.  And in spite of the fact that just about everyone coming in that evening had a Groupon, the staff was fantastic.

As they do not have a kitchen, all appetizers are cold, but we had a nice cheese plate which included 3 cheeses, olives, nuts, grapes, and dried fruit.  My only complaint was that the lahvosh-like crackers were really oily and not good at all.  Lose those and it would have been much better.

As for the wine, it was actually better than I expected.  Although I don't generally care for really sweet wines, both the Summer Rain and Peachy Keen were really enjoyable.  I just think of them more as a crisp summer beverage than wine.  I was surprised to like the Pinot Grigio as much as I did and may have purchased a bottle, but it was not available that evening.  The Miscela, an Italian blend, was a miss for me (too acidic for my taste), but the Malbec was better.  For after dinner wines, the Grande Finale was over-the-top sweet.  I would probably not drink more than a tasting.  The Porto Cocoa, however, was fantastic.  I generally stay away from Port because I dislike the "brandy burn."  But one whiff of this and I was hooked before I tasted it.  While it's not like terribly sweet, you definitely get the essence of chocolate.  We bought a bottle to take home, in fact, but I only saw one wee little glass.  My husband apparently mistook it for a Yoo-hoo and drank the rest.

Great place to begin your evening!  And because many of these young wines are sweeter, even my non-wine-drinking husband enjoyed it.	2011-02-19

review	-yxfBYGB6SEqszmxJxd97A	sqYN3lNgvPbPCTRsMFu27g	4	Quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.

My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.

For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.

The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.

If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.	2007-12-13
review	022T8YSRmb3b1BfwzO3F7Q	33vUIil_GCaT92aUaZhRXA	4	I had bought the Groupon for 2 games plus shoe rental earlier last week & decided to use them towards cosmic bowling Saturday night (it stated on the Groupon that you could do so). I called Thursday to verify that all of us (4 ppl total) could each use a Groupon & the employee I spoke to said yes, I also reserved a lane just in case they were busy that night.

We got there around 9:30pm & thank goodness we reserved a lane because it was packed. I presented my Groupons & was told we couldn't use them towards cosmic bowling, WTF?! The manager came over & explained that they cannot use the Groupon coupon code with cosmic prices, I was pretty annoyed so he gave us a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free games. We bought 2 extra games & then headed over to our lane. 

They had pretty good music playing & cool lighting. Idk if we just took our sweet ass time but we only got to play 3 of the 4 games. We had a lot of fun though! One thing that did kind of suck was that they closed at midnight, I am used to playing till 1am or later when we do cosmic. I almost forgot to mention the food/drinks. The soft pretzels with cheese were actually really good, as were the fries. The chicken fingers & grilled cheese were not as good, way too greasy. But it's bowling food so whatev! The pitchers of beer were $2 off so we got 2 for a lil under $15. 

All in all it was a good time so we'd definitely return!	2011-03-28
review	0UZ31UTcOLRKuqPqPe-VBA	W-VlJfTsCTBjknjIoTgUqw	4	As an Oakland Athletics fan, it is insanely frustration to see a such a beautiful stadium for a team that has only been in the league since 1998 and with only 1 World Series tittle to its name. Still, inside and out, it is a great park for baseball and in an amazing location right off the freeway and with a train stop in front of it. Looking forward to coming back this season for a live game.	2012-04-01

I would highly recommend this Library to anyone interested & I'll be coming back very soon for my next batch.	2010-09-07
review	4YX4ZtUqs6xtcc4AdjbpeQ	j1UagK_zBh0O5ITmcQFsvQ	2	Other circle K's are much cleaner than this one.  The best thing about this store is the Employees are friendly and nice.

I've been to this location in the morning and in the evening and there must be a point where the shift changes and they stop cleaning the bathrooms and emptying the trash.  In the morning everything is clean, by the time evening rolls around there are odd smells all over the store. It's a shame since it is a larger, newer looking store that it isn't cleaner.

I'll be back in hopes they clean up a little more.	2012-12-01
review	5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg	Vgs9VTdJ2oJMwGMow8xSCg	4	Went with my husband to Richardson's/Rokerij for the first time. He raved about this place. We went on a Wednesday night, with no reservation. The wait was about 1 hour. Luckily there were 2 bar seats that became available, so we took them. We ordered the 3 cheese flatbread appetizer and it was delicious. I had a large salad for dinner which was perfect, as I was not very hungry. My husband had the chicken enchiladas that I tasted and were very good. The food is cooked to order so it did take a while to get our meal, but it was worth the wait and service was excellent. While waiting, we chatted with several people at the bar, and one couple offered us a taste of their appetizer. We returned the favor, when flatbread came. One more thing, do not leave without getting the decadent truffle dessert. Heavenly, but not over done in any way. All in all a great experience. I do recommend reservations.	2012-01-20
review	6VRbbNQe5ouWmwsMebUMkg	vUB1ybxuOsh8yH8vDmQq9A	4	One liner: Great/Delicious Indian food w/ good happy hour specials but could improve on service. 

I am not quite sure I agree with the restaurant's color scheme for its name/logo but the food is great!

I really love Indian food and eating at this restaurant was definitely a treat for that reason. They have "Happy Times" or a happy hour menu. We started off with a King Fisher 22 oz ($1 off at happy hour) and a mango lassi with a shot of vodka. I'd recommend both the beer and the mixed drink.  

For appetizers,  we decided to get the Chicken Naan and the Spicy Chicken wings... both were freaking delicious. It looks like they used tandoori chicken to stuff the naan with and so it was scrumptious. 

They served it with a mint green chutney.. then there was also some red chutney and pickled veggies of some sort.. I don't know why but they gave us two different condiment sets and one of the mint chutneys tasted like it had a bit more salt and ginger than the first... the server said they came from the same batch so I'm not sure. 

We also ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala. It was really creamy and perfect for dipping naan in. I really didn't expect to find such good Indian food in AZ.

The other entree that we ordered was Chicken Tandoori... yeah probably too much Tandoori.. I didn't know at the time that I ordered but the spicy chicken wings is pretty much the same thing as the tandoori chicken.. but the tandoori chicken may have had a heavier coating of spices. I kind of wish the waiter would have offered his opinion that we had ordered very similar dishes and recommended something else but it is okay. All of tandoori style items were good.

They get 4 stars instead of 5 because I definitely believe the service could have been better. They seemed to only be really attentive at the start and then if there were any issues. I don't know if they were understaffed b/c it seemed like there was a waiter/manager, waitress, and then a bus-lady. My friend was definitely dying for some water during parts of the meals - she doesn't handle spicy too well. =P

Last and probably least... they also have a self-serve complimentary chai tea... i had the chai tea just from the pot and it was basically like warm milk with a tiny bit of cinnamon. My friend added some sugar to it and it turned okay/good. 

Entrees average about $10-$13. Naan ranges from about $1.50-$3. Appetizers during happy hour range from $3-$8+. Add in alcohol and you're looking at a not inexpensive meal but definitely good quality.	2011-08-14
